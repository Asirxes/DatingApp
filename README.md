# DatingApp
A dating application built from scratch using .NET and Angular. Entity Framework is widely used in the application, third party components are added. The styling of the application is created using bootstrap. The cloudinary service is used for the functionality of the photos, they are downloaded thanks to the API. The application is visually not responsive because I decided to focus on the most important elements.

To install the project run 'dotnet watch run' in API folder and 'ng serve' in client folder.

To use the project, you need to create a fake account. You will be logged in automatically. Then you can view users in the Matches tab. There you can like the user, see their profile or send them a message. This tab contains filters.

Liked users appear in the list tab.

In the news tab you can view correspondence with other users.

Thanks to the panel in the upper right corner by clicking edit profile you can edit your profile, upload photos, set a photo to the main photo, or delete photos (unless it's the only one).

To take full advantage of the application and see its functionality, I recommend setting up 2 accounts and initiating all possible interactions between them (messages, likes, browsing the profile, filters).
